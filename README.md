Handshake is an app created during Nasa Space App Challenge 2020. This app is developed to trace the peoples with whom a covid positive person has been recently in contact. This app uses Bluetooth to connect anonymously with other devices given those devices has this app already installed. This project was inspired from [Refrence](https://youtu.be/D__UaR5MQao).
